        <p>So I’ve basically disappeared for (almost) two years. No more blogging, hardly updating Twitter. The thing is, real life kicked in. It was kind of easy to blog frequently and be active on Social Networks when it was a part of what you did. Once we decided to call it a day on Afrigator, I decided at the same time that I don’t have much to say anymore anyway, and would call it a day on blogging as well.</p>
<p>18 months ago I started working at <a href="http://www.takealot.com">South Africa’s Best Online Shop, TAKEALOT</a>. It is a bunch of phenomenal individuals I’m priviledged to work with. Now you might think that working for an eCommerce site could not possibly be very exciting, but you cannot be more wrong! Technologically we’re faced with some interesting challenges and it is fast moving and extremely exciting. To cut a long story short, I’ve been busy!</p>
<p>I’ve also been very interested in learning <strong>Functional Programming</strong> and do try and fit learning all that in between the rest of my life. Initially I couldn’t really decide on a language I want to learn, but have made up my mind to go with <strong>Haskell</strong>. That said, I’m still somewhat intrigued by <strong>Lisp</strong> and <strong>Scheme</strong>, so it isn’t a done deal just yet. I do enjoy it though.</p>
<p>I also took up downhill skateboarding as a sport. When I’m not working or spending time with my family, I’m on the board. It all started when I complained to my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/jayx">Jayx</a> that it was such a big mission to get to the beach to go surfing and he told me about these long skateboards that is “like surfing on land”. The very next day I got my first longboard and about a month later I had my first broken arm. Still, it makes me feel more alive than you could ever imagine. I love it and will continue doing it for as long as I possibly can.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that is the past two years of my life. Exciting, interesting and enjoyable. I do miss writing an talking shit on the Internet, hence why I started this little site again. So, I guess you can say: <em>“I’m back, bitches!”</em></p>
