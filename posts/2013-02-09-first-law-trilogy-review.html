<p>The First Law trilogy is a (very) gritty fantasy story. It is written in a character point of view style (POV) and focusses on 6 characters much like George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire (A Game of Thrones), but that is as far as similarities go. The story is ultra violent. So much so, that when I first started reading it I found it quite hard to take it serious as the violence and torture is quite over the top, but if you push past the first few chapters, a magical story with twists and turns awaits you that has no equal.</p>
<p>I came across this when I searched for stories similar to A Song of Ice and Fire.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trilogy centers on the fortunes of three major characters: Sand dan Glokta, a crippled torturer in the Union’s Inquisition; Jezal dan Luthar, a self-centred nobleman and swordsman; and Logen Ninefingers, infamous barbarian warrior of the North forced into an uneasy alliance with the Union to defeat his sworn enemy, Bethod. In addition to these characters, the story follows Collem West, an anger-prone and constantly worried Union officer; the so-called Dogman, a world-weary and experienced northern scout; the fierce southern woman Ferro Maljinn, an ex-slave bent on revenge; and the scheming wizard Bayaz, First of the Magi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The characters are rich and interesting. Special mention to Glokta who is like a medieval detective working at unravelling conspiracies and secrets. The story is thick with twists and turns, but what I loved about it is all questions are answered, unlike so many other stories. Everything happens for a reason and the plot is clearly planned and brilliantly unfolded.</p>
<p>The violence is quite extreme, but you get used to it. Abercrombie has no equal when it comes to describing a fight, and there is plenty fighting happening.</p>
<p>I do not wish to spoil such a brilliant story for anyone, so I’d urge you to get the books and devour them. I enjoyed it more than anything I’ve read to date.</p>
<p>I leave you with this great image of my favorite character, Inquisitor Glokta.</p>
